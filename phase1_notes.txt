The curl -i command is used to include the HTTP response headers in the output when making an HTTP request.
Normally, when you run: curl https://example.com

Result:
<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head><title>Example Domain</title><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, 
initial-scale=1"><style>body{background:#eee;width:60vw;margin:15vh auto;font-family:system-ui,sans-serif}
h1{font-size:1.5em}div{opacity:0.8}a:link,a:visited{color:#348}</style><body><div><h1>Example Domain</h1><p>
This domain is for use in documentation examples without needing permission. Avoid use in operations.<p>
<a href="https://iana.org/domains/example">Learn more</a></div></body></html>

You only get the response body — the content returned by the server (like HTML, JSON, etc.).
But when you add the -i (or --include) flag: curl -i https://example.com

Results:
HTTP/2 200 
content-type: text/html

Step 1 - Quick HTTP header check and Curl: 
On the terminal in your codespace try run:
curl -I http://scanme.nmap.org

Result: 
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:53:49 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html

What to look for:

The first line shows the HTTP status (e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK or HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently). That tells you whether the request succeeded or was redirected.
Server: often reveals the web server software (e.g. nginx/1.18.0, Apache/2.4.41). This is a quick fingerprint.
Content-Type: tells you what kind of payload to expect (HTML, JSON, etc.).
Location: appears on redirects and shows the new URL the client should follow.
Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

What status line did you get and what does it mean?
    Status line is HTTP/1.1 200 OK and it means that the request and the server returned 
    succeeded and the server returned the requested resource (no redirect or error).

What is the Server header value? Is it specific (nginx/1.22) or generic?
    Server header is Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) and this is specific (includes server product, version and OS),
    not a generic value.



Step 2 - Fetch the full page body:
On terminal run this command:
curl http://scanme.nmap.org-o scanme.html
head -n 40 scanme.html

Result:
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  6974    0  6974    0     0  24272      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 24215


Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

What is the <title> of the page (if present)?
    The title of the page is Go ahead and ScanMe!
Do you see any <form> elements? What are their action attributes (copy them)?
    Yes two forms there are, 
    form 1: <form class="nst-search" id="nst-head-search" action="/search/">
    form 2: <form class="nst-search" id="nst-foot-search" action="/search/">


Step 3 - Compare curl and request:
Questions to answer in phase1_notes.txt:

Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
    Yes. curl returned "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" and the Python requests run showed Status: 200.
    Both reported the same Server header: "Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)".
    The requests final URL is "http://scanme.nmap.org/" (normalized with a trailing slash); curl -I showed no Location header (no redirect).

If different, what header or other factor might explain it (redirects, default headers, user agent)?
    Redirects / Location: Some responses are 3xx with a Location header.
    The python requests library follows redirects by default; curl -I doest not
    unless you use -L. So requests will show the final resource (200), while curl -l shows the
    intermediate 3xx.
    User-Agent (UA): Servers often return different content for browsers vs bots (or mobile vs desktop)
    based on UA. They might hide features or show challenge pages for unknown UAs.

Step 5 - Short synthesis:

Open phase1_notes.txt and append a 4–6 line summary answering:

What three pieces of information from the steps above would be most useful in a reconnaissance report, and why?

One quick defensive suggestion an admin could use to reduce information leakage from headers.
